### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sarbajit Ghosh

I'm a passionate researcher with a deep fascination for mathematics, symmetries, and the endless possibilities of the mind. My journey has taken me through the realms of structural design, derivatives modeling, and Python development, all while exploring the beauty of interconnected ecologies.

- ðŸ§  Exploring the beauty of mathematics and its applications.
- ðŸŒ¿ Navigating the world of poetics and narratives

I believe in the power of curiosity and the joy of learning, and I'm always excited to collaborate with fellow curious minds. Let's connect and explore the fascinating world of code, mathematics, and knowledge together!
